# Customizable Wordle

Customizable Wordle is a game of guessing a secret word by making guesses within a certain number of attempts. The game is customizable in terms of the length of the secret word and the number of attempts allowed.

This project is built with TypeScript and React, using CSS-in-JS for styling.

# Human-computer collaboration ðŸ¦¾

This was developed during a workshop on AI-assisted software engineering. I utilized ChatGPT in development and let it create the project structure and many of the files, which I then customized and corrected manually.
